# DGMD_E_28_Assignment_3A
This is the homework for Assignment 3A of HES DGMD-28. 

## Question:
* ## What are a) the most interesting and b) the most surprising Javascript constructs we have learned in the past few weeks.
  
Over the past few weeks, we have explored a variety of JavaScript constructs, some of which stood out as particularly interesting or surprising. The most interesting javascript constructs we have learned was the Event Delegation Pattern. Instead of attaching event listeners to multiple individual elements, we can attach a single event listener to a parent element and use event.target to determine which child element triggered the event. This is highly efficient for dynamically created elements. A surprising construct was JavaScript's handling of closures. Closures allow functions to remember the variables from their outer scope even after the outer function has finished executing.
